Question 1
How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

1 / 1 point

They make processing of images faster


* They isolate features in images


They make the image clearer


They make the image smaller

Correct
Spot on! Additionally, a properly designed convolution layer can even make training faster.

2.
Question 2
What does the Pooling technique do to the images?

1 / 1 point

Combines them


Makes them sharper


* Reduces information in them while maintaining some features


Isolates features in them

Correct
Good job! Pooling reduces information without removing all of the features.

3.
Question 3
True or  False. If you pass a 28x28 image through a 3x3 filter the output will be 26x26

1 / 1 point

* True


False

Correct
Nailed it!

4.
Question 4
After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, the output will be 56x56

1 / 1 point

True


* False

Correct
Yes! The output would actually be 13x13

Question 5
How does using Convolutions in our Deep neural network impact training?

1 / 1 point

* Its impact will depend on other factors.


It makes it faster


It does not affect training


It makes it slower

Correct
Correct! Using convolutions might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
