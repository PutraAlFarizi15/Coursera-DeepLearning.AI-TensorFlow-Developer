Question 1
What is the resolution of o the 70,000 images from the Fashion MNIST dataset?

1 / 1 point

82x82 Greyscale


* 28x28 Greyscale


28x28 Color


100x100 Color

Correct
Spot on!

2.
Question 2
Why are there 10 output neurons in the Neural Network used as an example for the Computer Vision Problem?

1 / 1 point

Purely arbitrary


To make it train 10x faster


To make it classify 10x faster


* There are 10 different labels

Correct
Exactly! There are 10 output neurons because we have 10 classes of clothing in the dataset. These should always match.

3.
Question 3
What does Relu do?

1 / 1 point

It returns the negative of x


* It only returns x if x is greater than zero


It only returns x if x is less than zero


For a value x, it returns 1/x

Correct
Correct! The rectifier or ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function returns x if x is greater than zero.

4.
Question 4
Why do you split data into training and test sets?

1 / 1 point

To make training quicker


To train a network with previously unseen data


To make testing quicker


* To test a network with previously unseen data

Correct
Nailed it! Splitting the data into training and test seat allows you to test the network with unseen data.

Question 5
True or False: The on_epoch_end function sends a logs object with lots of great information about the current state of training at the start of every epoch

1 / 1 point

* False


True

Correct
Absolutely! The function activates at the end of every epoch

6.
Question 6
Why do you set the callbacks= parameter in your fit function?

1 / 1 point

So that the training loops performs all epochs


Because it accelerates the training


* So, on every epoch you can call back to a code function

Correct
Thatâ€™s right! You can have it check the metrics and stop the training.
