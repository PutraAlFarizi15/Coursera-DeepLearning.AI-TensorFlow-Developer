Question 1
The diagram for traditional programming had Rules and Data In, but what came out?


1 / 1 point

* Answers


Binary


Machine Learning


Bugs

Correct
Exactly! Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.


2.
Question 2
Why does the DNN for Fashion MNIST have 10 output neurons?

1 / 1 point

To make it train 10x faster


To make it classify 10x faster


Purely Arbitrary


* The dataset has 10 classes

Correct
Exactly! There are 10 output neurons because we have 10 classes of clothing in the dataset. These should always match.

3.
Question 3
What is a Convolution? 

1 / 1 point

A technique to make images smaller


A technique to make images larger


* A technique to extract features from an image


A technique to remove unwanted images

Correct
4.
Question 4
Applying Convolutions on top of a DNN will have what impact on training?

1 / 1 point

It will be slower


It will be faster


There will be no impact


* It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!

Correct
Exactly!

5.
Question 5
What method on an ImageGenerator is used to normalize the image? 

1 / 1 point

normalize


flatten


rezize()


* rescale

Correct
Correct!

6.
Question 6
When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.

1 / 1 point

A copy will be made, and the copies are augmented


A copy will be made, and the originals will be augmented


* Nothing


The images will be edited on disk, so be sure to have a backup

Correct
That is, in fact, true. Nothing happens.

7.
Question 7
Can you use Image augmentation with Transfer Learning? 

1 / 1 point

No - because the layers are frozen so they can't be augmented


* Yes. It's pre-trained layers that are frozen. So you can augment your images as you train the bottom layers of the DNN with them

Correct
You've got it!

8.
Question 8
When training for multiple classes what is the Class Mode for Image Augmentation?

1 / 1 point

class_mode='multiple'


class_mode='non_binary'


* class_mode='categorical'


class_mode='all'

Correct
Nicely done!
