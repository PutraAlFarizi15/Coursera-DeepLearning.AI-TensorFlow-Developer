Question 1
How do you add a 1 dimensional convolution to your model for predicting time series data?




1 / 1 point

Use a 1DConvolution layer type



* Use a Conv1D layer type



Use a ConvolutionD1 layer type



Use a 1DConv layer type


Correct
2.
Question 2
What’s the input shape for a univariate time series to a Conv1D? 



1 / 1 point

[1, None]



* [None, 1]



[1]



[]

Correct
3.
Question 3
You used a sunspots dataset that was stored in CSV. What’s the name of the Python library used to read CSVs?




1 / 1 point

CommaSeparatedValues



* CSV



PyFiles



PyCSV


Correct
4.
Question 4
If your CSV file has a header that you don’t want to read into your dataset, what do you execute before iterating through the file using a ‘reader’ object?




1 / 1 point

reader.next



reader.ignore_header()



reader.read(next)



* next(reader)


Correct
5.
Question 5
When you read a row from a reader and want to cast column 2 to another data type, for example, a float, what’s the correct syntax?




1 / 1 point

float f = row[2].read()



Convert.toFloat(row[2])



* float(row[2]) 



You can’t. It needs to be read into a buffer and a new float instantiated from the buffer


Correct
6.
Question 6
What was the sunspot seasonality?




1 / 1 point

11 years



4 times a year



22 years



* 11 or 22 years depending on who you ask


Correct
7.
Question 7
After studying this course, what neural network type do you think is best for predicting time series like our sunspots dataset?




1 / 1 point

Convolutions



DNN



RNN / LSTM



* A combination of all other answers

Correct
8.
Question 8
Why is MAE a good analytic for measuring accuracy of predictions for time series?




1 / 1 point

* It doesn’t heavily punish larger errors like square errors do



It biases towards small errors



It punishes larger errors 



It only counts positive errors
